Contribution and Feedback
=========================

Feedback
~~~~~~~~
I'm always open to feedback in any form. Please do not consider to contact
me. You can find me on `Bitbucket`_ and `Jabber`_.

If you've got some problem with gpyconf or have ideas how to improve it,
please tell me about! If you think you've found some bug in gpyconf
(which is in all likelihood to be the reason for most problems using gpyconf),
please `file a bug`_ on Bitbucket. (You can also file bugs describing feature
requests, not only problems.).

Contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are you willing to contribute to gpyconf or have you written a frontend
or backend and want to share it with other users? I'm always open to new code,
if it appears to be useful for others.
Please contact me using the addresses named above.

(You might want to modify your code so that it fits into the
:doc:`coding_guidlines` before publishing it.)
